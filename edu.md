- Ruby is awesome.
  - And really easy and intuitive, just as advertised.
  - Symbols, strings, instance variables and instance methods does make attribute access a little bloated, but it’s honestly fine.
  - Mixins are really, really powerful.
- Rearchitecturing things is both really enticing and really daunting.
  - Essentially, I’m breaking the project so that when I put it together again, it’s newer and better.
  - But while I’m in the process of doing that, it’s kinda scary knowing my project is in a totally broken state.
  - If done over many days, it can become a little challenging to keep track of where I am and what’s left to do.
  - At times, I wonder if I’ve just irreparably broken it and it’ll never work again.
- When you come back to a project after months of inactivity, you will never thank yourself enough for your own documentation.
- Versioning a project and tracking its features with a changelog is probably a good idea.
  - Yeah, I find myself wishing I’d done it with Squarkdown.
  - Again, you often can’t expect how much projects grow beyond what you initially imagined.
