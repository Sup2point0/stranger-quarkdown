- Ruby is awesome.
  - And really easy and intuitive, just as advertised.
  - Symbols, strings, instance variables and instance methods does make attribute access a little bloated, but it’s honestly fine.
  - Mixins are really, really powerful.
- Rearchitecturing things is both really enticing and really daunting.
  - Essentially, I’m breaking the project so that when I put it together again, it’s newer and better.
  - But while I’m in the process of doing that, it’s kinda scary knowing my project is in a totally broken state.
  - If done over many days, it can become a little challenging to keep track of where I am and what’s left to do.
  - At times, I wonder if I’ve just irreparably broken it and it’ll never work again.
